# Project Euler
 ****

 ><a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a collection 702 of mathematical problems with varying difficulty which are designed to marry programming and mathematics by compelling the pparticipant into designing algorithms to solve the problems

A full list of the problems can be found at <https://projecteuler.net/archives>

This repository is all of my algorithms that i build on order to aid me in solving these problems.

I will be using a variety of different programming languages for these algorithms depending on what im learning at the time, or what i think would be best for the problem.
